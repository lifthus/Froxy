# If you want to use web dashboard, you have to provide root user credentials with --id and --pw flags.
# > froxy [--cert <cert-file> --key <key-file>] --id <root-id> --pw <root-pw>
# Using HTTPS is mandatory for web dashboard, so if you don't provide key pair, froxy automatically generates self-signed key pair for HTTPS.
# The default port is 8542 but you can change it with --port flag.
